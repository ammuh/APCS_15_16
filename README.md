# Ammar's APCS Repository #

Hello viewer! This is my APCS repository, where I do all my labs and make tool kits for extremely hard homework assignments. Feel free to look around. A couple things to note:

### File Structure ###

* ClassDocs: All the labs, most important directory.
* Webscraping: My experiment with Webscraping. Here I tried to extract the java textbook from different web pages on the website. If you are here for APCS help, ignore this folder.
* Workspaces/Fraction: Folders there since I started the repo, ignore, a lot of junk in them. I will take it out at some point.

### Ground Rules ###

* This repo is for reference only.
* DO NOT COPY ANY OF THIS. This repo is simply if you are stuck and need inspiration. You are cheating your self if you simply use my programs because you will utterly FAIL the test, and your lab grade won't matter.
* Refrain from using this repo as much as possible, pushing yourself through the lab is actually more worthwhile then peeking in these folder.
* If you end up copying my program, which includes anything from structure, to variable names, to quick tricks that I use, you will ruin this resource for everyone especially me, and I will end you. So please I highly stress, do not copy.

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Have any corrections? Go ahead and message me in any way, and I'll fix it.
